# Hello, welcome to the Question App that I developed with react.

## After clicking the Start Test button, an image and a question will appear on your screen. You have 30 seconds to answer each question and I would like to remind you that you will not be able to see the answers for the first 10 seconds when each question is loaded. After all the questions are answered, your answers and Correct answers will appear on the screen.

## You can access the live version of the project from the link below.
